## Notes

This app includes custom patches in `PhotopeaBundle/bootstrap.js` to enable offline functionality. Template and cloud-related features are disabled in the UI.

To build this app, you'll need to have the Electron-related packages installed. You can also update the Photopea bundle using scripts from GitFlic (see links below).
